Getting Started with Gemini DBAccess 
------------------------------------

Gemini DBAccess provides a way for a database to be accessed through JDBC in a modular environment like OSGi.


Required Bundles
----------------

To run Gemini DBAccess in OSGi you will need to have the following:

1. OSGi Framework

You may use Plugin Development Environment (PDE) in Eclipse, which will give you access to the Equinox 
OSGi framework, or you may execute outside of PDE and use any OSGi framework you choose, such as Felix. 

2. Database and JDBC driver

You should have installed and started your database server. DBAccess bundles do not start databases or servers. 
It is assumed that such servers are already running. You must also have the JDBC driver jars. If the driver is
not already OSGi-ready then you may need to create a bundle (see the User Guide for how to do this).

3. OSGi Enterprise API bundle

Some of the OSGi Enterprise APIs are used by DBAccess so the osgi.enterprise bundle must be resident. It normally 
includes both the source and the class files so it can be used for both execution and debugging.

4. The DBAccess bundles

There are typically two bundles for each supported database. The first bundle is the JDBC driver bundle 
and includes the JDBC driver code. If a driver is already OSGi-ready then it may already be bundlized
appropriately. If the driver is not already in an appropriate OSGi bundle then DBAccess will either provide 
one, or explain how to create one, depending upon whether the driver JARs may be distributed or not.

The second bundle is a DBAccess bundle that contains all of the logic to implement and register the 
DataSourceFactory service as specified by the OSGi JDBC specification.

For example, the following bundles provide support for the Derby client/server database: 

- org.apache.derby - the derby JDBC driver jars
- org.eclipse.gemini.dbaccess.derby - the Gemini supporting classes for Derby


Installation
------------

If running in PDE then unzip the files into a directory and import the various projects into your workspace.
If you are using the framework directly then unzip the distribution files and follow the documentation of
the framework for installing the bundles.


Configuration
-------------

Gemini DBAccess does not require any special environment configuration.
