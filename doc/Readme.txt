This milestone provides you with database access to the server Derby database version 10.5.1. 
To access other versions of Derby you may need to replace the derby.jar and derbyclient.jar 
driver jars inside the org.apache.derby bundle with the version that you require.

For an example of how to access a derby connection from an OSGi program run the sample program.

1. Ensure that your database is running (normally external to the OSGi framework).

2. Install and start the required bundles (see "GettingStarted.txt") in the framework.

3. Install and start the sample bundle.
